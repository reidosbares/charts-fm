# Deployment Environment

## Serverless (Vercel)
- The app is hosted on Vercel in a serverless environment - all solutions must be compatible
- Never implement cron jobs or scheduled tasks (use Vercel Cron or external services if needed)
- Never use fire-and-forget patterns - all async work must complete within the request lifecycle
- Avoid long-running processes; serverless functions have execution time limits
- Do not rely on persistent in-memory state between requests
- Be mindful of cold starts when designing performance-critical paths

# UI/UX Guidelines

## Modals
- Never use bottom sheet patterns for modals on mobile (e.g., `items-end` with `rounded-t-2xl`)
- Always center modals on all screen sizes using `items-center justify-center`
- Use consistent border radius (`rounded-xl`) across all breakpoints

## Mobile-First Design
- Always keep mobile users in mind when designing UI elements
- Avoid hover-only interactions like tooltips that require a cursor
- Ensure all interactive elements are touch-friendly with adequate tap targets
- Provide alternative ways to access information that would otherwise be shown on hover

# Database

## Migrations
- Never create database migrations yourself
- After finishing implementation that requires schema changes, ask the user to create the migration
