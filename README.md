## About

ChartsFM was created by me (GreatWhiteShark) as a personal project. As a music lover and long-time Last.fm nerd, I've always loved the custom visualisations and tools that people create using Last.fm data, and for a long time wanted to create my own.

This project was mostly created using the help of AI code editors. It is a bit of an experiment in "vibe coding" (but I *am* an actual developer).

I hope people will have fun using ChartsFM and poking around the project. Feel free to suggest improvements, flag issues, create pull requests.
